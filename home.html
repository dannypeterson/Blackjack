    <h3>The goal of the game is to draw (hit) cards until your total is as close to 21 as possible. However, you cannot exceed 21 (bust), or you automatically lose. Once you are comfortable with your card count, the dealer will then draw cards. Whoever is closer to 21 at the end of the round wins!</h3>
