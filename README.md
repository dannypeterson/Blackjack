### **_Description_**

This in-browser game of blackjack was created to provide practice gambling before hitting the casinos on vacation and losing every dollar that you put in.

### **_Technologies Used_**

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

### **_Getting Started_**

#### Click 'Deal' to draw two cards after placing your bet. The goal is to have cards that add up to as close as 21 without going over. If the dealer is closer to 21 than you are, you lose your hand and the bet you put in. If your cards are closer than the dealer to 21, you win double the bet you put in.
