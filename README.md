### **_What is Blackjack?_**

#### Blackjack is a card game where the player (you) and the dealer are dealt cards from a randomly shuffled deck. Whoever's total is as close to 21 without going over wins the round. If the total exceeds 21, you lose the round automatically. The player is dealt two cards, where they then have the option to draw another card (hit), or stay with their current total in order to near 21. However, only one of the dealers cards are visible so every move has a risk built in with it. Good luck!

### **_Getting Started_**

#### Click 'Start Game' to enter the table. Upon clicking "New Round," your cards will be dealt automatically and so will the dealers first card. You then have option buttons to hit, or stay. The dealers second card will then be revealed and they will draw until they reach 16 or more. After the dealer finishes drawing cards, your total is compared with the dealers and a display message will appear with the results. To start a new round, select the "New Round" button.
